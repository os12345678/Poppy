# Poppy
A proof-of-concept compiler for a type system I am creating as part of my Honours project.

### Aims
- Design an minimally viable object oriented programming language which implements fork-join parallelism.
- Design a static type system, implementing the core subset of the Kappa type system.

### TODO
[x] LLVM IR codegen
[] Finish linking LLVM backend
[] Introduce generics/polymorphism
[] Algebraic data types
[] Refine language syntax/structure


### How to use
dune exec bin/main.exe examples/poppy/<.poppy program>
